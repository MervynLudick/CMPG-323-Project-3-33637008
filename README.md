# CMPG-323-Project-3-33637008
## Structure
The Project is split into three projects. Core, Data and Web. The core application contains the business logic, in this case there is none as it is a simple crud app, but it contains the domain entities. It also contains the interfaces that are implement in the lower level projects. By doing this we can invert the dependencies and make all project dependant on the main project.
